The future of big data and artificial intelligence on dairy farms: A proposed dairy data ecosystem  

This Github page provides the figures used in the paper: The future of big data and artificial intelligence on dairy farms: A proposed dairy data ecosystem 

Fig. 1: Schematic representation of the proposed framework for a future dairy data ecosystem, illustrating interactions among commercial and research farms, edge devices, and the cloud intelligence layer (enterprise and R&D clouds). It shows data and model flows, with solid arrows pointing away from farms and dashed arrows pointing toward farms. Abbreviations: E = edge layer, FL = federated learning, RAW = raw data, R&D = research and development.

Fig 2. Examples of tensor representations and embeddings in dairy farm data. Multidimensional tensors from milk yield, activity, environment, and genomics are processed locally via standardized APIs to generate privacy-preserving embeddings
